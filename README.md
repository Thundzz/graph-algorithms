# Graph algorithms:

This repo hosts a few python scripts implementing miscellaneous graph algorithms in pure python. 

## Testing :
If you want to run the tests, you can use:

```
python -m unittest discover 
```

## Cleaning the directory:

After running the tests, you might want to get rid of the `*.pyc` files in project directory tree.  You can use the  `clean.sh` script to do just that.
